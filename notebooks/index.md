# Mathematical Python

![orbits](img/orbits.png)

[*Mathematical Python*](https://patrickwalls.github.io/mathematicalpython/) is an introduction to mathematical computing including:

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks, markdown and $\LaTeX$
* Basic [Python](https://python.org) programming: datatypes, variables, logic, loops and functions
* Scientific computing with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](https://scipy.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* Applications in calculus, linear algebra and differential equations

## Prerequisites

We assume the reader has completed undergraduate courses in:

* Differential calculus: derivatives, Taylor series and optimization
* Integral calculus: integrals, Riemann sums, sequences and series
* Linear algebra: vector and matrix operations, systems of equations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* Differential equations: first and second order equations, Euler's method and systems of equations
